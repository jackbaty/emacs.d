# emacs.d
My personal from-scratch emacs config

When I tire of [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs) changing things around under my feet, 
I become determined to go back to using my own, hand-rolled configuration

This is that configuration.

The defaults, layout, theme, etc are based on [Nano Emacs](https://github.com/rougier/nano-emacs).
